The project2 repository was created to work along with the "Git Real" course from codeSchool.
I have just altered this README with mission critical changes.

UPDATE 3262017

So, I am now actively uploading my stuff into Git. Todays addition was the bonus assignment from University MongoDB M101JS , week 1 , bonus assignment. It's a simple form that asks a user for movie name, imdb.com url, and year made. The form data is parsed from req.body and inserted into a mongoDB collection "movies". It works, so feel free to look it over.
